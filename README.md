# Face-Detection-Model
This machine learning project detects face with the accuracy of 92%. 
It is a beginer friendly code which makes understanding things easier.

In this project, we have make a use of a pre-trained model. 
We just need to import the model and feed our image.
It will then detect face in the image.

Another way to detect face is using harcascades. 
It is an xml file which consist characteristics to detect a particular features.
